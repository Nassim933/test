### correct_text

The "correct_text" function takes the text to be corrected as input. First, we will detect the language to choose the appropriate dictionary for text correction. We have dictionaries for English, French, German, and Spanish. If the detected language is in this list, the dictionary will be selected using the "load_dictionary" function. Then, the text will go through the "spelling_correction" function and return the corrected text. Otherwise, the original text will be returned.

### spelling_correction

The "spelling_correction" function takes the text and the dictionary corresponding to the text's language as input. It will first convert the text into a list of strings. Then, for each element in the list and for all words that start with a lowercase letter, if the word is present in the dictionary, it is considered correctly spelled. Otherwise, it is corrected using the _spellchecker_ library.
